# RTSP Streaming with GStreamer in Docker (Kali Linux)

This guide explains how to set up an RTSP streaming server using Docker with GStreamer on Kali Linux. 
The containerized solution ensures consistency and avoids dependency issues.

---

## 1. Install Docker (If Not Installed)

Before setting up the RTSP server, install Docker on Kali Linux:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```

Enable and start the Docker service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Verify Docker installation:

```bash
docker --version
```

---

## 2. Understanding the Docker Setup

The repository contains:

- **Dockerfile** â€“ Defines how the container is built.
- **rtsp_server.py** â€“ A Python script that sets up the RTSP server.
- **video.mp4** â€“ A sample video file for streaming.

### How the Dockerfile Works
- Uses **Kali Linux** as the base image.
- Installs **GStreamer RTSP plugins and Python**.
- Copies the **RTSP server script** into the container.
- Exposes **port 8554** for streaming.
- Runs the **Python RTSP server script** on startup.

### How `rtsp_server.py` Works
- Uses **GStreamer and Python** to create an RTSP server.
- Streams a **pre-recorded video file (`video.mp4`)**.
- Binds to **port 8554**, allowing clients to connect.

---

## 3. Building and Running the Docker Container

Navigate to the repository folder:

```bash
cd rtsp_gstreamer
```

### Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t rtsp-gstreamer .
```

### Run the RTSP Server
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8554:8554 rtsp-gstreamer
```

If successful, you should see:

```
RTSP Streaming Server started at rtsp://0.0.0.0:8554/stream
```

---

## 4. Playing the RTSP Stream

Use **GStreamer** to receive the RTSP stream:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -v rtspsrc location=rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/stream ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

This command:
- Connects to the **RTSP server at 127.0.0.1:8554**.
- Decodes the video and renders it on screen.

---

## 5. Running the Server in Detached Mode

To keep the RTSP server running **in the background**, use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8554:8554 rtsp-gstreamer
```

List running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

To stop the container:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

---

## 6. Debugging and Troubleshooting

### 1. Check if the RTSP Server is Running
```bash
ps aux | grep python
```
If the process is not found, restart the container.

### 2. Verify Port 8554 is Open
```bash
ss -tulnp | grep 8554
```

If the port is not listed, the server is not running correctly.

### 3. Restart the RTSP Server in Debug Mode
```bash
GST_DEBUG=3 python3 rtsp_server.py
```
This provides **detailed logs**.

### 4. Restart Docker Container
```bash
docker restart <container_id>
```

---

## 7. Cleaning Up Docker

### Stop all running containers:
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Remove the image:
```bash
docker rmi rtsp-gstreamer
```

---

## 8. Creating the RTSP Server Script

### Create the RTSP Server Script
```bash
nano rtsp_server.py
```

### Add a Video File
Place a sample video file (`video.mp4`) in the directory:

```bash
cp /path/to/your/video.mp4 rtsp_gstreamer/video.mp4
```

If you don't have a video, download a sample file:

```bash
wget -O rtsp_gstreamer/video.mp4 https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4
```

### Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t rtsp-gstreamer .
```

### Run the RTSP Server
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8554:8554 rtsp-gstreamer
```

Expected output:

```
RTSP Streaming Server started at rtsp://0.0.0.0:8554/stream
```

---

## 9. Test the RTSP Stream

Once the container is running, open a new terminal and test the RTSP stream using **GStreamer**:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -v rtspsrc location=rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/stream ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

This will **receive and display the video stream from the Docker container**.

---

## 10. Running RTSP Server in Background (Detached Mode)

If you want the RTSP server to run **in the background**, start the container in **detached mode**:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8554:8554 rtsp-gstreamer
```

To **list running containers**, use:

```bash
docker ps
```

To **stop the container**, use:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Ensuring low latency and synchronized playback** | Optimized RTP packetization and transmission logic |
| **Cross-platform deployment** | Dockerized the server for seamless setup and execution |

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for **live video streaming from webcams**.
- Implement **adaptive bitrate streaming** based on client bandwidth.

---

## Final Checklist

âœ… **RTSP server is running (`ps aux | grep python`)**  
âœ… **Port 8554 is open (`ss -tulnp | grep 8554`)**  
âœ… **Try playing with GStreamer (`gst-launch-1.0 ...`)**  
âœ… **Temporarily disable firewall (`sudo ufw disable`)**  
âœ… **Use the correct RTSP URL (`rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/stream`)**
